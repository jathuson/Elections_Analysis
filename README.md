## Election-Audit Summmary
This script can be used for any election with minor adjustments being made. The script is flexible enough to handle any number of candidates and any number of counties. This script can be adjusted for bigger elections such as federal election, where there is another level of calculations needed. For this, an additional for loop can be added to filter through each county/state to calculate the votes. Also, the lines of code that are responsible for calculating the numbers for each county can be adjusted for states or other regionas of interest. There can be additional lines added to help with determining the breakdown of each county and how each candidate based on counties.
